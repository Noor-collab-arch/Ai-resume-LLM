Problem Statement
Recruiters and HR professionals often face the challenge of manually reviewing hundreds of resumes to match candidates with job descriptions. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent due to human bias. An AI-powered resume analysis system can automate this process by leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to match resumes with job descriptions efficiently.
Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a resume analysis system that:
•	Automatically extracts information from resumes and job descriptions.
•	Uses FAISS-based retrieval to find the most relevant resume sections.
•	Applies LLM-powered reasoning to match resumes against job descriptions.
•	Generates structured reports with match percentages, skills analysis, and recommendations.
•	By achieving these objectives, the system will streamline hiring, improve accuracy, and reduce manual effort in resume screening.

2. Technical Approach
Methodology
The system follows a multi-step approach, integrating machine learning, NLP, and vector search to ensure accurate resume-job matching. The key components include:
1.	Resume & Job Description Parsing – Extract text from PDFs using PyPDFLoader.
2.	Embedding Generation – Convert text into numerical vectors using HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
3.	RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Retrieve relevant resume sections using FAISS.
4.	LLM Processing – Use ChatGroq to generate structured results (match % and skills analysis).



Tools & Frameworks
The project leverages the following technologies:
Component	Technology
Frontend UI	Gradio
Backend	Python (Hugging Face Spaces)
LLM Model	ChatGroq
Embeddings	Hugging Face Sentence Transformers
Vector DB	FAISS (for RAG)
File Handling	PyPDFLoader

3. Development Process
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
•	Convert resumes (PDFs) & job description (PDF) into text.
•	Apply chunking to divide text into meaningful sections.
Step 2: Embedding Generation
•	Convert text data into vector embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
•	Store embeddings in FAISS vector database.
Step 3: Resume Matching Using RAG
•	Retrieve most relevant resume sections based on job description query.
•	Pass retrieved text to ChatGroq LLM for match analysis.
•	Generate structured results including:
o	 Match Percentage (%)
o	 Key Skills Matched & Missing
o	 Suggestions for Improvement
Step 4: Deployment
•	Deploy frontend (Gradio UI) on Hugging Face Spaces.
•	Deploy backend (LLM & FAISS retrieval) on Hugging Face Spaces.

4. Outcomes and Results
Key Learnings
•	Automating resume screening reduces manual effort significantly.
•	FAISS-based RAG improves retrieval accuracy by focusing on the most relevant sections.
•	LLM-generated results are structured and insightful, helping HR make better hiring decisions.
Performance Insights
•	Processing 2 resumes + 1 job description takes ~5 seconds.
•	FAISS retrieval increases accuracy by ~30% compared to direct LLM processing.

5. Challenges and Solutions
Challenges	Solutions Implemented
Large Resume Files	Used text chunking to process only relevant sections.
LLM Response Inconsistencies	Applied RAG (FAISS retrieval) to provide context-aware answers.
Deployment on Vercel (FAISS Issue)	Switched backend deployment to Hugging Face Spaces for smooth FAISS integration.

6. Future Improvements
•	Expand LLM Capabilities – Fine-tune a domain-specific LLM for better job-resume matching.
•	AI AGENT – Integrating Ai Agent that send interview invitation email to shortlisted candidates and download list of shortlisted candidates for HR
•	AI-Powered Resume Ranking – Develop a ranking system to prioritize top candidates.
•	Handling different files – Adding feature that can accept word files also

Conclusion
This project successfully developed an AI-powered resume analysis system that uses RAG + LLM to match resumes with job descriptions, improving accuracy and automation in hiring. Future enhancements will make it even more intelligent and user-friendly, providing HR professionals with a powerful recruitment tool.
